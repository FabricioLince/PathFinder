# PathFinder
For PathFinder Functions in C++

Here we have classes for Breadth First Search, Dijkstra, Greedy Best First Search and A\*;
Their auxiliary classes/files such as Graph.h which specify Interfaces to be implemented for graph classes to be used with the search functions; CollectionWrapper/* which contains, as the name suggests, collections wrappers (specifically for Queue and PriorityQueue); 
and GridGraph.h, which contains an example implementation of a graph that represents a grid.
